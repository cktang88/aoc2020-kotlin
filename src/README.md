## Advent of Code (2020)

- this mostly follows https://kotlinlang.org/docs/advent-of-code.html

NOTE: I started this in Aug 2022 using Kotlin 1.7.10, so it's possible some of the newer lang features weren't there at the original time of the 2020 AOC release :)

- using newest K2 alpha compiler and gradle incremental compile flag from 1.7 also
- tried to be idiomatic Kotlin
